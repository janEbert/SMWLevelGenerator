\section{Introduction}

% TODO rewrite
Currently, AI is being used to reshape our lives. However, a common
discussion in recent times is malevolent usage of AI technology.
Generative methods especially have evolved rapidly, becoming much more
sophisticated than some years ago. With the advent of ``DeepFakes'',
refined language models, more digital political warfare and a large
spread of misinformation, people are rightfully on edge about the
misuse of AI technology, enabled primarily by the new advents in
generative deep learning. While we are lucky to live in such modern
times, we must not become na√Øve towards bad actors, either.

However, this thesis is not about misuse and fear of the future. We
are more interested in usage of AI for fun, artistic purposes and in
the end, this project will provide a research perspective into
combining natural language processing metods with non-language
generation. We present \emph{SMWLevelGenerator}, a pipeline to train
models capable of generating \emph{Super Mario
World}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World}}
(SMW) levels from scratch.

While game level generation is not a particularly new field of
research, Super Mario World provides a more complex world than any
related work has attempted to generate. Also, this work uses both more
and more recent models, focusing especially on the \emph{Transformer}
architecture~\cite{vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017}, originally introduced
as a encoder-decoder model for neural translation tasks. Due to its
functional similarity to the \emph{Long Short Term Memory}
architecture and its faster training time, we believe it is a good fit
for more challenging generation tasks such as provided by Super Mario
World.
