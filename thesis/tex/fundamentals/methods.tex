\subsection{Methods}

In this section, we will introduce the primary ideas we apply to
obtain a level generation pipeline. The methods will not be listed in
pipeline-sequential ordering (the order in which they will be applied
to obtain a generated level) but instead we will focus on the amount
of data the different methods generate. The sequence prediction task
is the most important part of the pipeline, generating a complete
level from a minimal amount of input. To obtain the first input of the
to be predicted sequence, we use a generative model. Finally, to
generate the metadata described on page~\pageref{par:metadata}, we use
an image processor that predicts the metadata of a level by analysing
its first screen~-- the output of the generative model and input to
the sequence predictor.

Before we list the models, we take a look at how to actually achieve
our task. By analyzing inputs of large dimensionality (the level's
layers and metadata), we want to generate similar, new levels of large
dimensionality (also level layers and metadata). This is a very
complex problem, requiring careful planning and a lot of computational
power to train a model large or refined enough to capture all the
essences we need for a new, enjoyable level. A generative adversarial
network~(GAN) would~-- with the present knowledge in machine
learning~-- be exceptionally hard to train on a task this large. A
lack of proper computational resources makes this even harder as
training a GAN requires training two full models in parallel. While a
GAN would be perfect in theory, allowing us to learn the dataset in a
much more abstract way and allowing the generation of levels that
capture much of what makes our dataset's levels what they are.

\subsubsection{Sequence Prediction}

Due to the complexity of our task,
Tasked with completing an unfinished sequence, we turn our head to
time series prediction models.
