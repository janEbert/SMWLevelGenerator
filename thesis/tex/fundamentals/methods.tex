\subsection{Methods}

In this section, we will introduce the primary ideas we apply to obtain
a level generation pipeline. The methods will not be listed in
pipeline-sequential ordering (the order in which they will be applied to
obtain a generated level) but instead we will focus on the amount of
data the different methods generate. The sequence prediction task is the
most important part of the pipeline, generating a complete level from a
minimal amount of input. To obtain the first input of the to be
predicted sequence, we use a generative model. Finally, to generate the
metadata described in section~\ref{sec:metadata}, we use an image
processor that predicts the metadata of a level by analysing its first
screen~-- the output of the generative model and input to the sequence
predictor.
