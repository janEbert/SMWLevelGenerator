\subsection{Setup}

With our code living in a Git~\cite{Git} repository, we want to
achieve~-- aside from the obvious version control advantages~-- an
easily reproducible but also portable environment (by which we mean no
large binary files). We provide several individual scripts for the
whole setup pipeline of our environment, including the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item downloading the required tools (optionally also additional ones)
\item downloading the properly filtered hacks (as we established in
  section~\ref{sec:hacks}, these are in patch form)
\item decompressing them to properly named directories (supporting
  either \texttt{tar} or \texttt{7z} as desired)
\item applying the patches to the original ROM
\item dumping all levels in each ROM
\end{itemize}
All of these are combined in a single convenience script
the user can execute in order to obtain their own environment. We
specify a default directory structure our source code is based on so
no paths have to be changed if using the convenience script.

Some time after our download of the over 300~hacks, SMW Central
implemented protection against too many requests in a certain time
frame. Even though we have set a generous wait time limit between
downloads, we understand that troubling the servers over and over for
the same files may not be desired. Due to this, we supply scripts that
fetch the files (tools and hacks) from their original source, SMW
Central, and scripts that download the files collected in a custom
location provided by us (the convenience setup script exists in both
versions).

While we mentioned portability, the scripts above are currently only
implemented in shell script\footnote{Bash compatibility, aiming for
  POSIX.}. For cross-platform support, these will be implemented in
Julia as well at a later time, eliminating another dependency. \\
For people either not interested in a manual setup or without access
to a shell script interpreter, we provide downloads for pre-computed
databases in the dimensions we support out of the box (listed in
section~\ref{sec:preprocessing}). If, on the other hand, the levels
are available, generating those databases is done in a single function
call.

Several other scripts allow further processing of the data, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item summarizing statistics of the hacks (like authors, rating,
  \dots)
\item removing duplicate levels based on their CRC32 checksums
\item removing levels with non-vanilla behavior
\end{itemize}
These have already been implemented in Julia.
