\section{Fundamentals}

We will now lay out the more theoretical groundworks of this thesis.
First, we answer what the problems we encounter in games are and how
our work relates to them. We will then introduce our environment~--
first in a high-level view, then diving lower into a more abstract
representation of what we are working with. Finally, we describe the
theoretical aspects of the methods we will be using in this thesis.
