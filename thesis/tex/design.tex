\section{Design}

The previous section introduced all the methods we are going to be
using in this work in an abstract way. We will now go into the
practical implementation of everything: how we did it and why we did
it that way. We will describe the shortcomings or advantages of our
approaches and list trade-offs we made to achieve our goals.
